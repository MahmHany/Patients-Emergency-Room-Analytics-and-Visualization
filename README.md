<h2>Project Overview</h2>
The Patients Emergency Room Analytics and Visualization Project is a business intelligence initiative developed to provide detailed insights into emergency room (ER) visit patterns and patient demographics within a healthcare facility. Built using a data visualization tool, this project features an interactive dashboard that tracks key metrics such as patient visit volumes, wait times, satisfaction levels, and referral patterns. It is designed for healthcare administrators, medical staff, and analysts to monitor ER performance, identify bottlenecks in patient care, and improve operational efficiency and patient satisfaction.

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ER Visit Overview: Key Performance Metrics</strong><br>
  This feature provides a snapshot of total patient visits, average satisfaction, service rating percentage, average wait time, and referral versus walk-in patient ratios for quick performance evaluation.</li>

  <li><strong>Visit Patterns: Weektype and Monthly Trends</strong><br>
  Bar and line charts display patient visits by weekday versus weekend and monthly trends, helping identify peak times (e.g., higher weekend visits) for better staffing and resource planning.</li>

  <li><strong>Demographic Breakdown: Age, Gender, and Race Insights</strong><br>
  Charts categorize patients by age group, gender, and race, offering insights into the patient population to tailor healthcare services and improve patient care strategies.</li>

  <li><strong>Departmental Referrals: Referral Distribution Analysis</strong><br>
  A bar chart shows referral volumes by department (e.g., General Practice, Orthopedics), enabling users to assess departmental workloads and optimize referral processes.</li>

  <li><strong>Wait Time Analysis: Age-Based Wait Time Heatmap</strong><br>
  A heatmap visualizes wait times across age groups, with darker green indicating shorter waits, helping identify disparities and improve patient flow efficiency.</li>

  <li><strong>Time-Based Views: AM and PM Performance Comparison</strong><br>
  Toggle between AM and PM views to compare visit volumes, wait times, and referral rates during different times of the day, supporting targeted operational improvements.</li>

  <li><strong>Historical Trends: Year-over-Year Visit Analysis</strong><br>
  A line chart compares total visits across years, allowing users to track long-term trends and assess the impact of operational changes on ER performance.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Tech Stack </h2>

- Power BI – Data visualization and dashboard creation.

- Power Query (M Language) – Data transformation and cleaning.

- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Custom measures and calculated fields.


<h2>Why This Project? </h2>

The Patients Emergency Room Analytics and Visualization Project is intended for healthcare administrators and medical professionals to monitor ER visit volumes, analyze patient demographics, and assess operational performance metrics like wait times and satisfaction levels. By providing insights into referral patterns, departmental workloads, and wait time distributions across age groups, the project enables users to identify inefficiencies, optimize resource allocation, and improve patient care processes. This initiative serves as a critical tool for enhancing ER operations, reducing wait times, and ultimately improving patient satisfaction and outcomes in the healthcare setting.
